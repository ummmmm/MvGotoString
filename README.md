# MvGotoString
Sublime Text 3 Plugin

This plugin will search across multiple defined directories for multiple defined file extensions, and then do an search for given text, returning the results using Sublime's quick panel.

Download the zip file, place the extracted folder in one of the following directories:

Ubuntu: ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/

OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/

Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\

Rename the folder from MvGotoString-master to just MvGotoString

You will need to update your user settings for this to work correctly.  Go to Preferences -> Package Settings -> Mv Goto String -> Default.  Copy those settings to the User settings file, updating the appropriate values.
